## Overview

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/w81Z8JHARTk) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval on how to build a Bitcoin startup. I started off using the [tesserect.js](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js?ref=devawesome.io) demo repository and added functionality on top of it. This app is still a work in progress. 

## Dependencies
- Node.js
- Firebase
- Stripe
- Paypal 
- Proof of Existence API
- Tesserect.js
- BioBERT
- hFigures Visualization
- Nodemailer

## Usage

#### Install the dependencies using npm (replace npm with 'yarn' if npm doesn't work)
npm install

#### And start the development server
npm start

## TODOs - Make a PR if you fix any. 

- Finish integrating Proof of Existence API and the Stripe/Paypal paywall. 
- Create a proper database schema for the health data
- Add Keyword Recognition via BioBERT, use the recognized keyword categories as columns in the database
- Replace the dummy health visualization with real health data
- Add in NodeMailer
